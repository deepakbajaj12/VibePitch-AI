# VibePitch Pro – AI Presentation Command Center

VibePitch Pro is the AI-powered productivity layer for the Logitech ecosystem, designed to help creators and founders craft perfect pitches instantly using physical hardware controls.

**Winner Category Target:** MX Creative Console + Actions SDK Integration.

## 🚀 The Concept
Instead of just a web app, VibePitch Pro transforms your **Logitech MX Creative Console** into a physical command center for your investor pitches.

- **Dial Interaction**: Rotate to adjust "Confidence" or "Hype" levels in real-time.
- **Keypad Buttons**: Instantly switch between Pitch Modes (Startup, Scientific, Game Trailer).
- **Actions Ring (Concept)**: Control teleprompter speed with a swipe.

## 🎛️ Hardware Integration (Simulation Included)
This project includes a fully interactive **Hardware Simulation Mode**. 
Click "LOGITECH MX MODE" in the top right corner to visualize how VibePitch communicates with the MX Creative Console.

## What it does
- **Physical AI Control**: Use hardware dials to tweak AI generation parameters.
- **Smart Pitch Generation**: Enter a 1-line idea, get a 30-second spoken pitch.
- **Live Tone Adjustment**: Change the emotion of the pitch without rewriting.

## Tech stack
- React + Vite
- Tailwind CSS (with custom animations)
